# BankMarketing-CaseStudy
The purpose of this research is to investigate and analyze how a telemarketing campaign can predict whether a consumer would sign up for a bank term deposit, with the answer being graded as "success" or "failure." Because this is a classification problem, one of the models we can use is Logistic Regression, which can provide information on the statistical significance of the predictors and their relationship to a binary outcome variable. With more clients who did not subscribe to the deposit, the data set is unbalanced. We utilized ideal cutoffs defined by sensitivity - specificity graphs to cope with this. On the testing data, the logistic regression model had a precision of 73.82 percent.
